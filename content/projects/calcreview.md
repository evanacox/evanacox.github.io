A review site made to house a bunch of practice questions for Calculus.

### Technologies used:

- TypeScript
- JSX / TSX
- React

### Important pieces of this project:

1. Used existing tooling to create a math display and interactive quiz
    - Adapted an existing animation library / LaTeX display library for use
      in this specific situation

### Things learned from this project:

#### Feature Creep is Real

The original intent of this project was a much broader scope than it is right now.
It was meant to *generate* math problems and solutions, not just display them. However,
due to a combination of the lack of powerful symbolic algebra / calculus tooling that 
could be used from JS/TS and my lack of knowledge in the space combined to a project that took
significantly longer than expected and ended up not having that portion in the final product.

Given a longer timespan I could have figured this out, but I allowed feature creep to come in
as I tried to generate more types of problems and ended up not having anything come out of it.
