These are projects I have made over the past few years, for a variety of reasons. Some are
hobby projects, some are school projects, all have been made entirely by me.

## [Chip-8](/projects/chip8/) (C++, SFML, CMake)

A complete Chip-8 emulator.

## [Calculus Review](/projects/calcreview/) (TypeScript, React, TSX)
